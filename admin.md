## How can we send commands ("SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE", etc) to individual nodes in the network, rather than treat them as pass-through intermediaries?

As defined in extension.md each node that joins the icdep will have a specific address unique to them and their location. If admin needs to send a command to a node in the network they can write a message on index card with the proper notation. A fraction to indicate the length of total message and the card number in the upper right corner, a 3 letter indicator of the content type in the upper left corner (ASC, BIN, UNI). They will then put the message in an evlope with the reciepient nodes address on the upper left, the admin address on the lower left, the envelope number on the upper right. 

The admin can send specific commands such as "SLEEP", "RESTART", "ARE-YOU-THERE" commands to nodes as content of the index card, the commands are sent as ASCII text. If a node recieves a command such as "SLEEP" from index cards they must check the sending address to ensure the message was sent from admin before following the command. This is to ensure another node or individual can't send commands to other nodes only admin has this privilege. Admin addresses are specific from the admin building (1080, UW Information Technology Building). If the command does not come from this address the node does not have to follow it.
