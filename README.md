Index Card Data Exchange Protocol

## Goals
- Two volunteers: Alice and Bob
- Alice must send a message to Bob
- I will tell/show Alice the message
- Alice communicates
- Bob tells us what message he received
- Alice and Bib can only communicate through writing on index cards
- Index cards can only hold four ASCII letters each
- Index cards can disappear
- Index cards can move slowly
- Bob can originate messages to Alice


**How does Alice communicate to Bob?**
